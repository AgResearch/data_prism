data_prism.py can be used to build discrete multivariate frequency/probability distribution, from 
large input datafiles (for example alignment files of nextgen sequence data), containing
mixed continuous and discrete multivariate data (the continuous variables are binned)    

data_prism.py contains a small kernel of methods. There are a number of examples included 
of using it with various different types of input such as tab-delimited text, fasta and fastq
, bam files, vcf files

Examples

taxonomy_prism.py : summarises tabular blast data by taxonomy (kingdom and family), across multiple input files
kmer_prism.py : summarises kmer distributions across multiple input files
